This is a simple to do list:
-update the .html to have a table to host the information information
    This will have 5 inputs and a submit button
    When this submit button is clicked, it needs to do these things
        -add the new data
        -re-calculate the monthly costs
        -clear the inputs of the form
        -check for over-budget, apply a CSS to the footer if true
        -add a delete or remove button onto the employees
